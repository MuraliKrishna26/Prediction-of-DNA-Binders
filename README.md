# Prediction-of-DNA-Binders
Identification of DNA-binding proteins is one of the major challenges in the field of genome annotation, as these proteins play a crucial role in gene-regulation. We have developed an model using various machine learning techniques to for predicting DNA-binding domains and proteins.
